# Webpagetest to InfluxDB

## Introduction

This is a small Node.js script to run automated website speedtests. It facilitates the [webpagetest tool](http://www.webpagetest.org/), either the public or your private installations. The result data is stored in [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/) for further analysis in [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) (templates will be provided at a later state).
The original version of that script is from [kjelloe](https://github.com/kjelloe/webpagetest).

You will find the instructions on how to [setup](../../wiki/Setup-Script) and [run](../../wiki/Run-Script) the script, as well as how to setup your [private Instance](../../wiki/Private-WebPagetest-Instance) of the WebPagetest tool in the [Wiki](../../wiki).
